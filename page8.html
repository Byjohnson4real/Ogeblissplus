  <meta name="description" content="He also said there may be interruption of democracy in the year 2019.

In a Youtube video, Joshua said he saw this while praying at an undisclosed ‘prayer mountain.’


He started by saying, “I am here because I know where I need to grow. When we know where we need to grow, it is victory itself.”

The prophet said he was there “to know the mind of God concerning this fearful year 2019 and also to pray for you and the world at large.”

He called on Nigerians to pray against “a stopover” and “the interruption of the democratic practice” as Nigeria prepares for the elections next month, February 2019.


“I like being one with nature – where there are no disturbances, where we don’t need to close our eyes to pray,” he explained, indicating he had been in prayer and fasting for several days to begin the New Year.

“I developed this habit right from the beginning of my ministry… When I need a quiet place, I run to the wilderness, to the mountain,” he continued, conspicuously barefooted, simply clad and holding his Bible.

He proceeded to offer prayer for his viewers, stating that “whatever hinders you to greatness” would “give way” and “whatever that does not reflect Jesus in your life” would “be removed.”">

<br>
<br>INTERNATIONAL
<br>
<br>Joel 2:28-32 King James Version (KJV)
<br>
<br>
<br>28 And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:
<br>
<br>29 And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit.
<br>
<br>30 And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.
<br>
<br>31 The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the Lord come.
<br>
<br>32 And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be delivered: for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance, as the Lord hath said, and in the remnant whom the Lord shall call
<br>
<br>NIGERIA
<br>
<br>Lamentations 3:22-23 King James Version (KJV)
<br>
<br>22 It is of the Lord’s mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.
<br>
<br>23 They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness.
<br>
<br>INDIVIDUAL
<br>
<br>Isaiah 3:10-11 King James Version (KJV)
<br>
<br>10 Say ye to the righteous, that it shall be well with him: for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.
<br>
<br>11 Woe unto the wicked! it shall be ill with him: for the reward of his hands shall be given him.
<br>
<br>RCCG
<br>
<br>Psalm 91 King James Version (KJV)
<br>
<br>91 He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.
<br>
<br>2 I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust.
<br>
<br>3 Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence.
<br>
<br>4 He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler.
<br>
<br>5 Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day;
<br>
<br>6 Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday.
<br>
<br>7 A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee.
<br>
<br>8 Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked.
<br>
<br>9 Because thou hast made the Lord, which is my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation;
<br>
<br>10 There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.
<br>
<br>11 For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.
<br>
<br>12 They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.
<br>
<br>13 Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.
<br>
<br>14 Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.
<br>
<br>15 He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.
<br>
<br>16 With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.
<br>
<br>Thank God the Holy spirit and prophesy into your life.</p>
